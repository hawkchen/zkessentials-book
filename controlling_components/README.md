# Controlling Components

We can contruct the user interfacw with ZK components but also control them. In this chapter, we continue to use the previous chapter's example, but we will remove the 3 items with hyper links in the sidebar and replace them with a redirecting action. To achieve this, we will write code in Java for each item to respond to a user's clicking and redirect the user to an external site.
